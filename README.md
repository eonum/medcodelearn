# medcodelearn
Playground for machine learning with medical coding data and medical classifications.

Tasks
* propose codes (denoising, auto encoding, recommender systems, Analog collaborative filtering / matrix factorization)
* learn a grouper algorithm (classification, outlier detection)
* search codes (medical classification, NLP)
* exploration and visualisation (Visualised Bayes Nets, common combinations of comorbidities)
* medical coding data generation
* ..

Algorithms
* classical machine learning algorithms (FFNNs, RF, PCA, RBM)
* deep learning (deep autoencoder, stacked RBMs)
* ..

Libraries
* scikit-learn
* Theano
* PDNN
* Pylearn2
* ..
